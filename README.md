# What is Web Programming?

Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. The most common languages used for Web programming are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

In Web Programming, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for building the web pages/sites. Also I used CodeIgniter which is an open-source software rapid development web framework, for use in building dynamic web sites with PHP.
